With this tricked out version of bashttpd, you won&#39;t need a high-powered web server like Apache nor nginx (I didn&#39;t feel like learning nginx, and certainly don&#39;t care for learning Apache).  IN PROGRESS but does work way, way better than nothing.  Chrome renders differently, but in a pinch it will function halfway. | kenneth558 | 1 |
