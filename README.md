| 98 |  [KingdomComeIMeanItAndIMeanNowSurveillance](https://github.com/kenneth558/KingdomComeIMeanItAndIMeanNowSurveillance) | A web page (NOTE: Only Firefox &amp; Pale Moon browsers give approved rendering) and some server-side web server scripting in a mini web server called bashttpd.  Even looks good on Android devices as far as I&#39;ve seen, though working the sliders is more difficult when your finger touch point is larger than them.  With this tricked out version of bashttpd, you won&#39;t need a high-powered web server like Apache nor nginx (I didn&#39;t feel like learning nginx, and certainly don&#39;t care for learning Apache).  IN PROGRESS but does work way, way better than nothing.  Chrome renders differently, but in a pinch it will function halfway. | kenneth558 | 1 |
